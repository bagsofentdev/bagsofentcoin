          The radar room aboard the Presidential Flagship Liberty One was unusually quiet.<br><br>
Out on the black water of the midnight Sea, a convoy of low, fast boats cut through the waves. <br><br>
No lights, no flags, their holds packed tight with sealed plastic cargo stamped with skull-and-crossbones labels in block letters.<br><br>
In the command chair sat President Trump.<br><br>
He had insisted on being there personally.<br><br>
“Sir,” said Admiral Vance, pointing to the glowing blips on the screen. “Confirmed trafficking fleet. International waters. They’ll hit the coast by dawn.”<br><br>
President Trump adjusted his windbreaker—navy blue, embroidered with a gold eagle the size of a dinner plate.
“Not tonight,” he said.<br><br>
He didn’t wait for a committee vote. He didn’t wait for a briefing slideshow. He stepped onto the deck as the sea wind whipped around him and gave a single order:<br><br>
“Deploy the Thunderhawks.”<br><br>
From the belly of Liberty One, a squadron of sleek strike aircraft roared into the sky. Their engines lit the clouds orange as they streaked toward the convoy.<br><br>
The traffickers barely had time to react.<br><br>
Precision flares cut through the darkness. Warning broadcasts blared across emergency channels. Engines stalled under targeted strikes that shattered hulls and ignited fuel lines. The night exploded into pillars of fire reflected across the waves.<br><br>
One by one, the boats were consumed.<br><br>
Within minutes, the sea was silent again. Nothing but the hiss of steam and the crackle of dying flames.<br><br>
By dawn, nothing remained of the trafficking fleet.<br><br>
Nothing but debris.<br><br>
And hundreds... no, thousands... of small sealed plastic bags bobbing in the swell, shaken loose as the boats met their fiery end. The white powder inside drifted beneath a rising sun, skull labels gleaming in the light.<br><br>
President Trump stood at the rail, watching Coast Guard recovery ships move in formation across the water.<br><br>
“Collect every last one,” he ordered. “Not a single bag reaches our shore.”<br><br>
By midday, containment nets stretched across the sea like silver spiderwebs. Crews in protective gear hauled the floating cargo aboard secure vessels. Evidence was cataloged. Routes were mapped. Names were added to international watchlists.<br><br>
On the coastline hundreds of miles away, citizens woke to calm waves and empty beaches.<br><br>
That evening, President Trump addressed the nation from the deck of Liberty One.<br><br>
“They thought the ocean would hide them,” he said. “They were wrong.”<br><br>
Behind him, the sun sank red over a sea now clear of both traffickers and their cargo.<br><br>
The bags of fent never made landfall.<br><br>
And far offshore, beneath the darkening sky, patrol ships continued their silent watch; engines low, radar bright.<br><br>
President Trump remained at sea, scanning the horizon for the next shadow moving across the water.
